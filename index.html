            <h3>Abril Fatface + Roboto</h3>
            <p>Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance. The Extended Latin character set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and Northern Europe.</p>
            <p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.</p>

            <h3>Archivo + Judson</h3>
            <p>Archivo is a grotesque sans serif typeface family originally designed for highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of the font are both crafted for high performance typography. It was designed to be used simultaneously in print and online platforms and supports over 200 world languages.</p>
            <p>Judson is a serif font designed for African literacy. It contains as many glyphs and precomposed combinations that I know of for all African languages written in Latin-derived alphabets. It uses OpenType tables for correct placement of diacritical marks, including stacked marks. Care has been taken so that all characters are easily distinguished, even in the italic face. The medium roman face has support for the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA.)</p>

            <h3>Crimson Pro + Work Sans</h3>
            <p>Crimson Pro is a serif typeface family: Contemporary, clear, classic and rounded/open. Something for a college textbook, editorial websites and any reading experience with book-length texts It contributes to the tradition of beautiful Garamond-inspired typefaces, often called “Garalde” or “Old Style,” and has 8 named weights, in Roman and Italic, and is available as a Variable Font with a Weight axis.</p>
            <p>Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, such as those by Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei. The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page.</p>
